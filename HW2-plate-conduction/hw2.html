<b><font size="+1">Homework 2: Finite Volume Solution of a Simple
Conduction
Problem</font></b>
<br>
&nbsp;
<p>Solve a conduction problem involving a bar with internal heat source
and cooling at the surface by a fluid bath. Do not take advantage of
any
symmetry in your solution.&nbsp; Use symmetry to check your
solution.&nbsp;
Within the bar the conductivity (k) can be assumed constant and the
conduction
equation is:
</p>
<p><img src="hw2_files/hw20image0.gif" height="36" width="174"></p>
<p>Surface Heat flux surface is given by the expression:
</p>
<p><img src="hw2_files/hw20image1.gif" height="62" width="228"></p>
<p>Use the following values for your solution:
</p>
<p>T<sub>fluid</sub> = 300K
</p>
<p>h = 25,000 w/m<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>k = 85 w/m/K
</p>
<p>q = 3.0e9 w/m<sup>3</sup>.
</p>
<p>Assume an infinite length bar (2-D problem), with a 0.004m by 0.03m
rectangular cross-section.
</p>
<p>To solve the problem divide the bar into a 10x10 array of equal
sized
volumes. Begin by solving two related problems to test your program.
Assume
that the origin of an x-y coordinate system is located at the center of
the bar. For the first problem allow the above heat flux condition to
the
liquid at x = ±0.002m, but set the heat flux to zero at the y =
±0.015 m surfaces (adiabatic boundary condition). For this
situation
the temperature is independent of y and you can compare your
computational
results against an analytic solution for T(x). Give me a plot comparing
the results at the centers of 10 volumes in the x direction to the
analytic
results.&nbsp; Confirm that there is no change of temperature in the y
direction.&nbsp; Provide me with your derivation of the analytic
solution or a reference to a book containing the solution.<br>
</p>
<p>With that done shift the 1-D problem by 90 degrees. Use the above
heat
flux condition to the liquid at y = ±0.015 m, and set the heat
flux
to zero at the x = ±0.002m surfaces (adiabatic boundary
condition).
Again provide me with a plot with both finite volume and analytic
results.
</p>
<p>Now that you have confidence in your program, run the full 2-D
problem
with heat flux to the liquid on all four surfaces. Provide me with a
clear
printout of temperature at the center of all volumes. I prefer a file
with
one line for each y row of volumes, and ten numbers in each line
corresponding
to the ten volumes in the x direction. Give me two digits to the right
of the decimal for your numbers (e.g. 910.11, 1011.23).
</p>
<p>Clearly write out the finite volume equations that you use,
including
special cases at boundaries.&nbsp; Submit your write-up, plots, and
program
to the drop box on <a href="https://cms.psu.edu/frameIndex.htm">ANGEL</a>.&nbsp;
To make my life easier, either imbed everything in a single Word
Processor
file (Word, WordPerfect, or FrameMaker), or collect your material in a
single archive file using&nbsp; Winzip, zip, pkzip, or tar.
</p>
<p><b>The Fine Print:</b>
</p>
<p>To make my grading easier, I expect you to adhere to good
programming
practices. The <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/steady.f90">main program</a> should just
be
an outline. Create separate subprograms to initialize terms in your
linear
equations, to <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/LUsolveM.f90">solve the equations</a>, and
to
output the solution.&nbsp; Parameters such as conductivity, volumetric
heat source, number of mesh cells, and mesh cell sizes should all be
stored
in variables that are <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/DataM.f90">initialized once </a>in
your
program. Include adequate comments describing the purpose of each
subprogram,
defining all subprogram arguments, and describing all key steps in the
program.&nbsp; If you are programming in Fortran 90, use the new "<a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/f90/statements/real.html">KIND</a>"
attribute to specify the precision of your arithmetic.&nbsp; Define the
KIND with the Fortran 90 intrinsic function "selected_real_kind".&nbsp;
I recommend that you use my module named "<a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/IntrTypeM.f90">IntrTypeM.f90</a>"
to make this definition, and a similar definition for integers.
</p>
<p>Whenever you are testing a numerical solution method, your first
method
for solving linear equations should be direct (Gauss Elimination or
Lower/Upper
Decomposition).&nbsp; This minimizes opportunities for error because of
simplicity of the matrix data structure, and availability of tested
solution
subprograms.&nbsp; In fact, you should almost never write subprograms
to
solve linear equations.&nbsp; Plenty of very good public domain
software
is available for linear algebra (e.g. <a href="http://www.netlib.org/">NetLib</a>).&nbsp;
For this homework feel free to use the same <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/LUsolveM.f90">subprograms</a>
that I have called from my sample <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/steady.f90">main program</a>.
</p>
<p>This assignment may seem a little frightening.&nbsp; However, I've
shown
you most of my program in the links above.&nbsp; The coding that I
haven't
shown you requires less than 100 lines of Fortran to generate the
matrix
and right hand side resulting from the finite volume equations.&nbsp;
You
may use any of the coding linked from this page as a start for your
solution, including a template for the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jhm/ME540/homework/hw2/SetEqnM.f90">SetEqn</a>
module.
</p>
<p><b>Selecting a Programming Language:</b>
</p>
<p>You should talk to your research advisor.&nbsp; If he or she states
that you must use C for your research or if C is the dominant language
for applications in your research area, then use it for this and other
programs in this class.&nbsp; If this is not the case, regardless of
previous
programming experience, I recommend that you work in Fortran 90 or the
latest standard Fortran 95.&nbsp; Yes, some professor has probably told
you that Fortran is a dead language.&nbsp; I was told the same thing in
1968, and have heard it frequently since, so I don't take such
statements
too seriously.&nbsp; Fortran has always been designed specifically for
Scientific and Engineering programs.&nbsp; This is particularly evident
now in the support for array operations in the language structure and
intrinsic
function set, and related support for high performance computing.&nbsp;
In addition, more Fortran public domain equation solution subprograms
will
be available to you than if you use C.
